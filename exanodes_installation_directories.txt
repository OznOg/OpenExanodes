NOTE: Could Linux(4) ([[http://tldp.org/LDP/Linux-Filesystem-Hierarchy/html/opt.html][/opt]]) be subsumed by a modified Linux(3)?

See FHS description of /usr/local at [[http://www.pathname.com/fhs/pub/fhs-2.3.html#USRLOCALLOCALHIERARCHY][pathname.com]].

From [[http://www.vistaheads.com/forums/microsoft-public-windows-vista-installation-setup/176056-program-files-programdata.html][VistaHeads]]:

  Program Data is a "virtualized" folder used by Vista so that programs and
  users running with normal rights can work around a security feature of
  Vista. Only full Administrator users can write to the Program Files folder,
  so any time a program or user with lesser rights wants to write to Program
  Files, that action is redirected to Program Data instead.

  The ProgramData folder contains all your application data, like program
  settings, user data, etc, for all of the installed programs on the
  computer.

  Just for reference, the ProgramData folder holds the same files that were
  contained in the \Documents and Settings\All Users and \Documents and
  Settings\All Users\Application Data folders in XP.

On Windows, Exanodes' config files should *not* be stored with the binaries:
if a user removes Exanodes, then reinstalls it (during an upgrade, for
instance) in a different directory, the binaries won't be able to find the
existing config files. That's why on Windows the config files should be
stored in C:\ProgramData.
