= Hyper-V current issues =

hEva is a short term for "Exanodes Virtual Appliance for Microsoft Hyper-V".


Global notice:

One of the only configuration known to have proper behavior with multicast is
to set "Legacy Network Adapter" for all hEva and to uncheck "Allow management
OS to share this network adapter" in Virtual Network's connection type.

If one ore more hEva don't have network connection after that, swap the network
cards on the same tab.

This is HIGHLY empirical with very poor performances (30 IOPS on 2nodes/2disks)
and extremely unstable configuration (lost the quorum). This issue doesn't occur
with non-legacy network adapter.


== Multicast not received in hEvas ==

Multicast frames are not received by hEvas although they are correctly sent
by hEvas and received by HyperV.

Current workaround is to use a broadcast address instead of a multicast one.


== Drives added in "Physical Hard Disk" mode aren't recognized by hEvas ==

Drives can be added to a hEva with two methods:
 - a passthru method (drives aren't virtualized and given directly to hEva)
 - a file interface method (a big 0ed file is created on a filesystem).

 The first method is currently defective.

 Workaround is to use the second method.
